            <p class="animate fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.4s">Media has evolved over the years, with knowledge accessible with a click. For people without disabilities, this access to knowledge, entertainment and connection to their friends and family is often taken for granted. But one cannot ignore the individuals who live with their disabilities and have an equal right to access all these facilities. Companies and Individuals have also realised that making data accessible broadens their reach and market. We have curated five such artifacts where individuals or organisations have made a conscious effort to be more inclusive to the Deaf, Blind, visually impaired and Hard of Hearing Individuals.
              <br>
              <br>
              In an effort to be more inclusive, our website reads out the various paragraphs and words, when the mouse hovers over it. Words, when highlighted, are also read out. The titles of every page are in the font Sans Forgetica which is a font designed using the principles of cognitive psychology to help one remember better. It can be beneficial to mitigate the onset of Dementia. The Fonts are also Sans Serif as this makes the text easier to read for People with Dyslexia. The videos linked are subtitled and we have tried our best to ensure that the text colour is clearly visible against the background.
Inclusive Websites and content need not be bland. A world catering to everyone is full of untapped opportunities and exciting new ideas. It is up to us if we wish to explore them.

            <p class="animate fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.4s">"The web evolved into a powerful, ubiquitous tool because it was built on egalitarian principles.." (Lee, 2010).
              The vision with which the world wide web was conceptualized demands inclusion of all humans, represented and deprived, in this era of 'Internet of Things.' 
              <br><br>
              However, before the internet became the behemoth that it is, television was and arguably still is, the most accessible platform for receiving mediated content. Semantic discourses on the term platform over time have revealed four territories (Gillespie, 2010), and the one we shall be exploring is the 'architectural' aspect, for television provides a discrete architectural structure for the dissemination of content.
<br> In the spatial context of India, the government regulated channel 'Doordarshan' stands out as the channel with the farthest reach. It, thus, is responsible for providing content democratically, for the privileged and for persons with disabilities. With that context, the discussion of the ASL content on Doordarshan becomes incontestable. 
</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="container"><p><br>ASL or American Sign Language is a natural language that serves as the predominant sign language of Deaf Communities. One can easily recollect the morning bulletin by Smriti Nagpal, a popular Indian sign language interpreter, for the hearing impaired which was done by employing ASL. Many such programmes run on the channel throughout the day, effectively bridging the gap between the privileged and persons with hearing disability.

        <br>A more contemporary example of the same would be country’s 65th Republic Day, when Doordarshan for the first time, broadcast the Republic Day parade on TV with simultaneous sign language interpretation for people who are deaf or hard of hearing.
      <br><br>The significance of this initiative was that almost all English news channels took the feed from DD News with sign language interpretation, which meant that there was greater delivery of content. This was done for the benefit of the 18 million people in India who are hearing impaired.

              The privilege of using media depends on how accessible a particular platform is to different individuals from varying backgrounds and different disabilities. Why should Instagram be limited to only those who have the complete faculty of vision?
              @bodyposipanda is the account of British Body Positivist and Feminist Megan Crabbe. She is an extremely vocal advocate of inclusivity and respect for all types of bodies. An interesting feature about all her posts is that her captions always include “Image Descriptions” which aid her visually impaired followers who use their screen reader software to better understand her posts. This image description helps the people with these disabilities to understand the message the post is trying to portray. For example, the image description of this particular post  “Megan is sat in a rowboat against a backdrop of bright blue sky and pink flowery hills, she's wearing a lilac bikini with green sarong and smiling as the breeze blows her hair across her face. There are words edited onto the image that say "look at the top left cloud... Look at the left side of the boat... Look at my left hand... Register to vote,” describes in detail the image and scenic setting, while also describing the words written on the post, so that no follower is excluded from the message of the post. Adding this image description would probably take a few extra minutes but the accessibility of the post increases greatly.
               <br>
              </p>
              </a>
            
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="container"><p>Instagram had also rolled out new features for the visually impaired in November 2018 which includes custom and automatic “Alt Text.” Alt Text is the literal image description of the post; the content creator can add Alt Text by simply clicking on the advanced settings button before posting. A tutorial on how to add Alt Text is linked here: <a href="https://getqualifyd.com/2019/01/15/instagram-alt-text/">https://getqualifyd.com/2019/01/15/instagram-alt-text/</a>  
        . If the content creator has not added their custom Alt Text, Instagram uses Artificial Intelligence to describe the post as accurately as possible to user. With the addition of these features, Instagram has made a conscious decision to not exclude a significant chunk of the marker which includes 285 million visually impaired individuals according to the blog post announcing these features. Inclusivity is not just about social responsibility but can also be a smart business decision. By not using these features for posts, one makes their posts inaccessible to significant number of people, which reduces the impact of the post. This is especially important for Social Media Influencers, whose livelihood depends on their Impact and reach. Accessibility is a key step in the journey to combat Privilege.

            <p class="animate fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.4s">For years major sources of entertainment have not been able to cater to audiences who are blind and deaf. While most forms of entertainment have excluded people with disabilities, either through the medium or due to lack of representation. However, comedy has been one of the few forms that has seeked to amuse all. From Charlie Chaplin to comedy podcasts, shows have been there to bring a smile to everyone’s faces. To continue the tradition, the art of sign-language comedy has been recently growing in popularity to entertain not only the deaf but even people without disabilities. In fact, with its growing popularity, the privilege of being able to enjoy stand-up comedy is no more confined to a select sect of audience.
 
              <br><br>
              
 
</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="container"><p><br>Some might even argue this growing art form is much more engaging than usual stand-ups as it is far more physical, and more in command of the audience’s attention. With increased awareness, the performance opportunities for the sign language comics have increased greatly, thereby, creating a path for them to enter the mainstream media. This art form has not only increased the accessibility of people to more forms of entertainment, but also created an opportunity for deaf and/or dumb people to explore their talent at stand-ups.<br>

        <br>The comedian featured in the video, Keith Wann is a famous ASL comedian and has been performing since 2002. He started performing with an ASL improv group, but later went on to do solo comedies. Today, with his ingenious talent, he is one of the most sought-after performers in the ASL community.
There is more to sign language comedy than just the act. One of the major challenges faced in this art form is the interpretation. Sign-language interpretation is more than just delivery of words; it is delivering the same emotion to the hearing audience that is being conveyed to the deaf.
<br>
<br>
People like Keith Wann are an inspiration to people who want to perform but were held back by their disabilities. With increasing awareness, sign-language performances have become more prevalent, be it in comedy or theatre. It is only a matter of time now for this to enter the mainstream media.

              Amongst the most vital mediated tools available out there are magazines and news media.
Magazines, tabloids and news media are a more traditional means of making the world a smaller
place – allowing the consumers of these forms of media to explore the world while seated
comfortably in their armchairs. <br><br>
In these busy times that have been made extra-dynamic with the advent of modern technology and
the internet, it is often times harder to remain an updated and prudent world citizen. There are
many consumers that may not have the accessibility or in fact, the time to consume news media.<br><br>
Enter: the mobile phone. Just as in the realm of biology, evolution and obsolescence extend to the
world of mediated content and information as well. As such, we are witnessing printed forms of
news media – newspapers, tabloids, magazines – being replaced at a considerable pace by mobile
and tablet based digital web applications of the once printed content. Not just nationally, but also
internationally, we see many news media publishers flooding the various online stores with their
web applications.<br><br>
While this process is improving accessibility and reducing the amount of privilege a potential
consumer requires to actually consume the content, these forms of new media were still not
consumable by people with visual impairments.

      <div class="container"><p> <br>Keeping this in mind, we have chosen the Economist’s mobile based web application as an example
        of an artefact that breaks this wall of inaccessibility. The Economist, an English-language weekly
        magazine-format newspaper edited in London, is one of the most widely consumed left-of-centre
        news media magazines in the world – the first choice of thousands of political commentators and
        analysts.<br><br>As the adjoining picture explains, the mobile based application has editions that can be downloaded
        as and when they are published and available on shelves across the world. To access the material,
        the user needs to download the issue they are interested in. To ensure accessibility to users with
        visual impairments, the Economist embeds a downloadable soundtrack with each issue that it

            <p class="animate fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.4s">The right to access is a human right. Hence, in the context of media, accessibility should not be constrained to mere basic sources of information, but democratization of media should apply across all media platforms, for all types of content. Entertainment is a basic human necessity, and should be available to all. However, something as ubiquitous as music by its solely auditory nature deprives a certain set of people from experiencing it - the deaf. Hence, it is one's privilege to be able to experience music.
 
              <br><br>
              Music is not merely art, but lies at the intersection of art and media, as it conveys message and emotions. Hence privilege in terms of access to music is a form of privilege in media. Thomas Clifton defines music as "the actualization of the possibility of any sound whatever to present to some human being a meaning which he experiences with his body—that is to say, with his mind, his feelings, his senses, his will, and his metabolism".

      <div class="container"><p><br>  Hence, music is not the sequence of sounds and silences but the way the body perceives this sequence. It is not constrained by the sense of hearing but is experiential, and employs all the senses. However, most music produced across the globe does not make attempts to produce harmony that can be experienced through other senses. Music can be experienced by people with hearing impairments in three ways: visually, through vibrations, and through ASL (American Sign Language). Innovation in this area has led to the development of devices that provide the experience.
<br>
        <br>A breakthrough innovation came about in 2016, with the launch of "Coke Studio for the Deaf". This initiative by Coca-Cola's Coke Studio, in partnership with the Deaf Reach programme of the Family Education Services Foundation aims to offer music experience to around 9 million people of Pakistan, who were deprived of the experience because of hearing impairments
      <br><br>The programme is designed in a way that it facilitates music experience for people with no barrier in terms of requirement of hearing ability to be able to access it, by using a structured combination of lights and vibrations, generating a sense of harmony and rhythm. 

      <br><br>This step towards access directly counters the privilege in media one can have by means of their sensory abilities, and has the potential to democratize music, making it truly inclusive.
